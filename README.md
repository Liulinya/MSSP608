# MSSP 608 on GitHub
This GitHub respository contains all of the Google Colab materials from the first run of MSSP 608 - Practical Machine Learning. The Google Colab links to all the notebooks will be updated here and the Lecture/Homework notebook sources will be uploaded here in folders.

# Using the Colab Notebooks
First open the link to whatever notebook you want to run (you must also be signed into a Google Account). Then follow the link that says "Open in Playgroud"

After this, simply navigate to the run tab and click "run all" now you have a fully run, completely editable jupyter notebook running in the cloud! Yay!

If you get a warning, just hit "Run Anyways".
